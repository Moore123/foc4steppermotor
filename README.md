### foc4steppermotor

The target of this project is to create a board for developing protocol of FOC steppermotor controler

### Passed:
```
    1.extern board power feed
    2.MCU running
    3.MCU flash
```

### Tobe test:
```
    1.FOC driven steppermotor
    2.rs485 
    3.A13333 SPI feed back
```

### MayBe FIX
```
    SWIO  <- pull-up
    SWCLK <- pull-dn
```
